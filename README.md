2. I spent many hours on this project
3. I was able to impliment a 16 bit carry look ahead adder!  Its over 1000 lines/gates long. I used python (carrylookahead.py) to make it if you are curious how I was able to do it. Maybe I'll also make a script to convert it to only nand down the line. 
`python3 carrylookahead.py >> Add16.hdl`
